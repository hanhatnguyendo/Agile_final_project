# Agile Product Catalog – Final Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the practical application of Agile sprint planning and execution within a GitHub-based workflow. It includes a structured Kanban board used to simulate a real sprint cycle by organizing and managing user stories across different development phases.

The project covers the end-to-end Agile lifecycle - from creating a product backlog and refining it into a sprint plan, to progressing user stories through a mock sprint using GitHub Issues and Project Boards.

- Listing and querying products

- Hosting the application in a cloud environment
